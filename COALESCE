The COALESCE function accepts an unlimited number of arguments. It returns the first argument that is not null. If all arguments are null, the COALESCE function will return null.
COALESCE(arg_1,arg_2,...arg_n)

The COALESCE function becomes useful when querying a table that contains null values and substituting it with another value. 

SELECT item,(price - COALESCE(discount,0)) 
AS final FROM table

Keep the COALESCE function in mind in case you encounter a table with null values that you want to perform operations on!
